# Manual testing

Here is a list of the manual testing that was carried out to ensure that the Lifesort API works as intended at the time of deployment. These tests are designed to test each created view for functionality.

The intended funcionality of Lifesort is that users can only access their own profile and tasks and an error should be returned to the user is they have attempted to access a task or a profile of another user.
