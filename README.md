# Lifesort - Back-end API

Lifesort is a task management application, it allows users of the site to sign up and login with their own profile. From there they are able to create tasks: A detailed custom task, a lesser detailed quick task and also holiday tasks.

The custom task option allows the user to create a more detailed task with the ability to create a title, description, set a due date, set a start date among other options as well. The aim for the custom task option is to be able to set a task or an event that would require extra detail such as setting up an event for an annual meeting.

The quick task option allows users to create a less detailed task with the ability to create a title, description, priority, due date, and current status of task. The aim for the quick task option is allow users to create a list of normal everyday tasks that would need completing such as mowing the grass. 

The holiday task option allows users to create a detailed task list focused on what would be required for a holiday. The aim for the holiday task option is to allow users of the site to organise themselves for a future trip away.

Users of the site have full CRUD control over their own tasks with the ability to see their tasks all at once if they are using a desktop computer or in separate lists they can click on a task to see a single task. The user has access to the edit function and delete function throughout these pages. If a user is on a smaller device they have access to all of the tasks created but due to the application having infinite scroll the access is separated out to each individual list of tasks created. 

Users of the site also have access to their own profile page and have the ability to edit their profile and update their profile image which is displayed in the navigation bar of the application.

Lifesort was designed with the focus on an application that can be used on desktop computers but also on mobile devices as well.

Due to the nature of the application I designed the tasks within the application to only be accessed by the task owner and this goes same for the profile model.

Lifesort has a separate front-end built with React and a back-end built with the Django-Rest-Framework. Both of the front-end and back-end have been deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) This README is for the back-end API section of the application.

## Planning

Planning for the application was based on an agile methodology utilising GitHubs issues and projects tabs to create user stories for the site. There are user stories which are for the project goals of the site and what I wanted to achieve and I set up project tasks as well which incorporate the what is required for each step of the project.

The user stories requiring implementation to achieve a minimimum viable product where then mapped to API endpoints to required to support the desired functionality.

## Database Schema

The database schemas were planned with th APi endpoints using an entity realtionship diagram.

![Lifesort database schema](static/images-database/entity-diagram-life-sort.png)

### Profile model

The profile model is to allow the user of the site to create their own profile. It serves an important purpose as it links to all of the tasks models to link everything together.

The profile model contains the following fields:

 * id - Automatically generated by the Django-rest-framework which is unique to each profile instance.
 * owner - One to one relationship with a specific user instance.
 * date created - Date and time for the creation of the profile.
 * date updated - Date and time when the profile was last updated.
 * image - Image that is displayed witin the users profile.

![Profile model schema](static/images-database/profile-schema.png)

### Custom task model

The custom task model is designed to allow the user to set a more detailed task that has multiple options and plan for a bigger event task in the future.

The custom task model containds the following fields:

 * owner - Primary key of the user who generated the task.
 * date created - Date and time for the creation of the task.
 * date updated - Date and time when the task was last updated.
 * due date - The due date of the task.
 * start date - The date that the user expects to start the task.
 * completed state - Choice list allowing the user to choose from in progress/overdue/completed.
 * priority state - Choice list allowing the user to set priority of task low/medium/high.
 * description - Description of the task.
 * title - Title of the task.
 * travel required - If travel is required for the task.
 * budget - Budget requirements for the task.
 * work or leisure - If the task is for work or leisure purposes.

### Quick task model

The quick task model is designed to let a user create a short quick task.

The quick tast model contains the following fields:

 * owner - Primary key of the user who generated the task.
 * date created - Date and time for the creation of the task.
 * date updated - Date and time when the task was last updated.
 * due date - The due date of the task.
 * completed state - Choice list allowing the user to choose from in progress/overdue/completed.
 * priority state - Choice list allowing the user to set priority of task low/medium/high.
 * title - Title of the task.
 * description - Description of the task.

![Quick task model schema](static/images-database/quick-task-schema.png)

### Holiday task model

The holiday task model is designed to let a user create and plan for a holiday with various holiday focused options to make planning for a holiday less stressful. The holiday task model would work better in a mobile app setting as items could be ticked off quicker and this was the main focus of this model for a future verison of the application.

The holiday task model contains the following fields.

 * owner - Primary key of the user who generated the task.
 * date created - Date and time for the creation of the task.
 * date updated - Date and time when the task was last updated.
 * title - Title of the task.
 * description - Description of the task.
 * completed state - Choice list allowing the user to choose from in progress/overdue/completed.
 * date of holiday - Date of holiday.
 * budget - Cost of holiday.
 * clothes - If any clothes are required for holiday.
 * passport - If passport is required.
 * holiday insurance - If any insurancees are required.
 * suitcases packed - Suicases fully packed.
 * holiday paid - Holiday paid in full yet.
 * car hire - If car hire is needed.
 * tickets - If any tickets are required.
 * entertainment - If there is any entertainment needs.

## Testing

I thoroughly tested Lifesort API with both manual testing and automated testing to ensure the application was working as designed and expected.

### Manual testing

The manual testing I completed can be found here: [Manual Testing](MANUAL_TESTS.md). It describes the steps I went thorugh to manually ensure the API is working correctly.

I also ran the code I wrote through the [Code Institute linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to ensure the code I wrote was free from errors.

![Python linter test result](static/images-testing/python-linter-result.png)

### Automated testing

I also wrote a series of automated testing suites in order to further test and uncover any hidden bugs that may not have been discovered with the manual test. The autmated testing also further reinforces the manual tests.

Here is the results from the testing within the terminal.

![Test results from terminal](static/images-testing/test-results-terminal-api.png)

I also installed and used [Coverage python testing](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.2.7/) to ensure I was testing as much of my code as possible.

## Resolved Bugs

Any bugs that were found during testing are documented in the user stories bug section. 

### When testing the API bugs found where as follows

#### Receiving a warning in terminal regarding unordered lists

 * I checked all models.
 * Custom task model did not contain a class meta.
 * Added in the class meta.
 * Ran all migrations.
 * Checked tests were now passing.

#### During testing was able to create a minus budget for custom tasks

 * Checked models were correct.
 * Checked custom task serializer.
 * Added budget into serializer.
 * Ran migrations.
 * Checked tests were passing.

#### During manual testing discovered could set due date before start date in custom task model

 * Researched how to validate dates correctly I referenced this [Dev Diary](https://www.flaviabastos.cadjango-rest-framework-adding-datetimefield-format-serializer-validation/).
 * Removed the validation from the model to the serializer.
 * Checked tests were passing.
 * Updated all models to have the date validation in the serializer.

#### During final deploy to Heroku kept on receiving error messages

 * Checked the heroku build log.
 * Check all config vars were correct.
 * Checked Procfile was correct.
 * Found error in Procfile it was not configured correctly. I updated the code and deployed the APi tested it and it was working as intended.
